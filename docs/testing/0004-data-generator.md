# Data Generator

The `epr-backend-journey-tests` repository include a data generator for local testing

You can execute the data generator using:

```
npm run generatedata:allMaterialsMixed:withUserLinking
```

This will generate 5 organisation details, registrations, and accreditations (All linked via the same orgId / refNo) with all materials and waste processing types (Reprocessor, Exporter)

Spreadsheets for Summary Logs can also be generated by using the Spreadsheet generator. Please refer to the README.md in the `epr-backend-journey-tests` repository for more details.

It is also possible to generate data for the Test environment using the CDP Portal `epr-backend-journey-tests` test suite runner. By passing in the profile of `generate`, 5 users with all materials and waste processing types (Reprocessor, Exporter) will be created automatically in the `Test` environment.
