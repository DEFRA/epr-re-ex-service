## Who is using this service

### Producers

Producers are organisations who use packaging for products sold to consumers.

This packaging can be recycled for use in a circular economy, which is a sustainable economic model that aims to eliminate waste and pollution.

Producers purchase PRNs/PERNs (Packaging Recycling Notes/Packaging Export Recycling Notes) from Operators to fulfil their obligations to regulators.

> [!INFO]
> Producers do not have direct access to this service,
> their access to PRNs is via another service called RPD and there is an integration between these services.

### Operators

Operators are the regulated organisations who handle waste material.

They fall into two categories of activity: reprocessors and exporters.

These activities are not mutually exclusive, operators can perform both activities on the same or different materials.

#### Reprocessors

Reprocessors receive waste material and recycle it into a raw material for use in the economy, e.g. paper waste is recycled into cardboard boxes.

#### Exporters

Exporters export waste material to a third party, e.g. a waste processing plant in another country.

### Consultants

Consultants act on behalf of multiple operators, they can usually perform the same actions as privileged users.

### Regulators

The regulators are the authorities responsible for the regulation of waste material. There are four nations in the UK that have regulatory bodies:

1. England: Environment Agency
2. Northern Ireland: Northern Ireland Environment Agency
3. Scotland: Scottish Environment Protection Agency
4. Wales: Natural Resources Wales

### Service Maintainers

The Defra team(s) responsible for maintaining the service used by operators, consultants and regulators.

## How do users access this service?

Operators & consultants access this service via [this auth mechanism](pepr-lld-auth-ui.md).

Service Maintainers and Regulators access this service via [this auth mechanism](pepr-lld-auth-admin-ui.md).

All requests to the EPR Backend API are verified with [this auth mechanism](pepr-lld-auth-api.md).

## What can these users do?

The following actions depend on the user's role:

1. Create or update a user
2. Upload a summary log, which in turn creates or updates a waste record and may update the waste balance
3. Create or update a PRN
4. Create or update a report

Note that updating an entity _may_ include changing its `status`. See a summary of entity statuses below, or see the [Low Level Design](pepr-lld.md) for more details.

## What are the statuses of each entity?

### Organisation

1. `created`: organisation has been created but has not yet been approved by the regulator
2. `approved`: organisation has been approved by the regulator
3. `rejected`: organisation has been rejected by the regulator
4. `suspended`: organisation has been suspended by the regulator
5. `archived`: organisation has been archived and can no longer be used

### Registration

1. `created`: registration has been created but has not yet been approved by the regulator
2. `approved`: registration has been approved by the regulator
3. `rejected`: registration has been rejected by the regulator
4. `suspended`: registration has been suspended by the regulator
5. `archived`: registration has been archived and can no longer be used

### Accreditation

1. `created`: accreditation has been created but has not yet been approved by the regulator
2. `approved`: accreditation has been approved by the regulator
3. `rejected`: accreditation has been rejected by the regulator
4. `suspended`: accreditation has been suspended by the regulator
5. `archived`: accreditation has been archived and can no longer be used

### User

1. `created`: user has been created but has not yet completed a login process
2. `active`: user has completed the login process
3. `archived`: user has been archived and can no longer be used

### Summary Log

Summary logs transition through the following states based on what has been accomplished:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> preprocessing
    preprocessing --> preprocessing: CDP Uploader callback "pending"
    preprocessing --> rejected: CDP Uploader callback "rejected"
    preprocessing --> validating: CDP Uploader callback "complete"
    validating --> invalid: Validation errors found
    validating --> validated: Validation completed successfully
    validated --> submitting: User submits summary log
    submitting --> submitted: Waste records synced successfully
    rejected --> [*]
    invalid --> [*]
    submitted --> [*]
```

1. `preprocessing`: file uploaded to CDP Uploader, undergoing virus scan and file validation
2. `rejected`: CDP Uploader preprocessing failed (malware detected, invalid file type, or size exceeded)
3. `validating`: CDP preprocessing passed, content validation against business rules in progress
4. `invalid`: content validation found errors
5. `validated`: validation completed successfully, prospective modifications ready for user review
6. `submitting`: user has submitted the summary log, waste record sync in progress
7. `submitted`: waste records have been synced successfully

### Waste Record Version

1. `created`: the first version of a waste record that created the entity, this version can be used to understand the original data
2. `updated`: subsequent updates to the waste record, this version can be used to understand the changes made to the original data
3. `pending`: updates that are not yet approved by the regulator because they affect closed reporting periods

### PRN

1. `raised`: PRN has been raised but has not yet been issued to the producer
2. `issued`: PRN has been issued to the producer but has not yet been accepted by the producer
3. `accepted`: PRN has been accepted by the producer
4. `rejected`: PRN has been rejected by the producer
5. `cancellation-requested`: PRN has been requested for cancellation by the operator
6. `cancelled`: PRN has been cancelled by the regulator

### Report

1. `created`: report has been created but has not yet been submitted to the regulator
2. `submitted`: report has been submitted to the regulator
3. `approved`: report has been approved by the regulator
4. `rejected`: report has been rejected by the regulator

## Workflows

### Organisation, Registration & Accreditation management

#### Regulator approval and edit of Organisation, Registration and Accreditation

Use case: As a Regulator, I want to edit and approve an organisation, registration and accreditation so that the service can be used by Approved Persons & PRN Signatories.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Regulator
    participant AdminUI
    participant Backend
    participant DefraID
    participant Frontend
    actor User

    Regulator->>AdminUI: edits & approves organisation
    AdminUI->>Backend: updates organisation,<br> creating new data model for Organisation entity

    Regulator->>AdminUI: edits & approves registration
    AdminUI->>Backend: updates registration,<br> creating new data model for Registration entity<br> and nesting it within Organisation entity
    Backend->>DefraID: creates DefraID account<br> for each new Approved Person<br> & PRN Signatory in Registration

    Regulator->>AdminUI: edits & approves accreditation
    AdminUI->>Backend: updates accreditation,<br> creating new data model for Accreditation entity<br> and nesting it within Organisation entity
    Backend->>DefraID: creates DefraID account<br> for each new Approved Person<br> & PRN Signatory in Accreditation

    User->>DefraID: complete account creation
    User->>Frontend: access service
```

#### Regulator suspension of Organisation

TBD as all MVP 1.2

#### Regulator suspension of Registration

TBD as all MVP 1.2

#### Regulator suspension of Accreditation

TBD as all MVP 1.2

### User Management

#### Automated addition of an Approved Person or PRN Signatory

Use case: As a Regulator, I want to create an Approved Person or PRN Signatory automatically when the registration or accreditation is approved so that they can access the service.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Regulator
    participant Service
    participant DefraID
    actor User

    Regulator->>Service: approves registration or accreditation via Admin UI
    Service-->>DefraID: creates DefraID account for each new Approved Person & PRN Signatory
    DefraID-->>User: notifies user of account creation
    User->>DefraID: completes account creation
    DefraID-->>User: confirms account creation complete
    User->>DefraID: logs in
    DefraID-->>User: redirects user to service
    User-->>Service: requests dashboard
    Service-->>DefraID: authenticates user
    DefraID-->>Service: user authenticated
    Service-->>User: returns dashboard page
```

#### Regulator adds an Approved Person or PRN Signatory

Use case: As a Regulator, I want to add an Approved Person or PRN Signatory manually after the registration or accreditation has been approved so this new user can access the service.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Regulator
    participant Service
    participant DefraID
    actor User

    Regulator->>Service: creates user via Admin UI
    Service-->>DefraID: creates DefraID account
    DefraID-->>User: notifies user of account creation
    User->>DefraID: completes account creation
    DefraID-->>User: confirms account creation complete
    User->>DefraID: logs in
    DefraID-->>User: redirects user to service
    User-->>Service: requests dashboard
    Service-->>DefraID: authenticates user
    DefraID-->>Service: user authenticated
    Service-->>User: returns dashboard page
```

#### Regulator removes access from an Approved Person or PRN Signatory

Use case: As a Regulator, I want to remove an Approved Person or PRN Signatory manually after the registration or accreditation has been approved so this user can no longer access the service.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Regulator
    participant Service
    participant DefraID
    actor User

    Regulator->>Service: edits user via Admin UI
    Service-->>DefraID: updates DefraID account
    DefraID-->>User: notifies user of account change
    User->>Service: requests authenticated page
    Service-->>DefraID: authenticates user
    DefraID-->>Service: user not authenticated
    Service-->>User: returns error page
```

#### Approved Person adds a User

Use case: As an Approved Person, I want to add a basic user so that they can access the service.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Approved Person
    participant Service
    participant DefraID
    actor User

    Approved Person->>Service: creates user
    Service-->>DefraID: creates DefraID account
    DefraID-->>User: notifies user of account creation
    User->>DefraID: completes account creation
    DefraID-->>User: confirms account creation complete
    User->>DefraID: logs in
    DefraID-->>User: redirects user to service
    User-->>Service: requests dashboard
    Service-->>DefraID: authenticates user
    DefraID-->>Service: user authenticated
    Service-->>User: returns dashboard page
```

#### Approved Person removes access from a User

Use case: As an Approved Person, I want to remove access from a basic user so that they can no longer access the service.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Approved Person
    participant Service
    participant DefraID
    actor User

    Approved Person->>Service: edits user
    Service-->>DefraID: updates DefraID account
    DefraID-->>User: notifies user of account change
    User->>Service: requests authenticated page
    Service-->>DefraID: authenticates user
    DefraID-->>Service: user not authenticated
    Service-->>User: returns error page
```

### Summary Log submission

#### User makes open month waste adjustments

Use case: As a User, I want to upload a summary log with open month waste adjustments so that I can update existing waste records and see any impact on the waste balance.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant Frontend
    participant Backend
    participant CDP
    participant SQS
    participant Worker
    participant S3

    User->>Frontend: select activity, site & material
    User->>Frontend: initiate upload
    Frontend->>CDP: request upload URL
    CDP-->>Frontend: uploadUrl
    User->>CDP: upload summaryLog.xlsx
    CDP->>S3: store file
    CDP-->>User: redirect to Frontend upload-success page
    User->>Frontend: GET upload-success page
    Frontend->>Backend: POST /uploaded (create SUMMARY-LOG)
    Backend-->>Frontend: 200 OK
    Frontend-->>User: redirect to status page
    CDP->>Backend: callback with S3 details
    Backend->>SQS: send validation message
    Backend-->>CDP: 200 OK
    SQS->>Worker: trigger validation
    Worker->>S3: fetch summaryLog.xlsx
    Note over Worker: parse summary log + compare against WASTE-RECORDS
    Worker->>Backend: update SUMMARY-LOG entity (status: validated)
    User->>Frontend: view progress page
    Frontend->>Backend: GET summary log
    Backend-->>Frontend: status & validation results
    Frontend-->>User: displays how uploaded summaryLog.xlsx<br> will affect WASTE-RECORDS when submitted
    User->>Frontend: submit SUMMARY-LOG
    Frontend->>Backend: submit
    Backend->>Backend: create new WASTE-RECORDS
    Backend->>Backend: update existing WASTE-RECORDS
