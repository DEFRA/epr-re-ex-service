## API Endpoints

The endpoints below are grouped by the entity they are associated with, the idea here being by providing
self-explanatory endpoints that can be used to retrieve entities as resources.

Consumers can use the data in a way that is most appropriate to their use case and without requesting further endpoints
to service their needs if the project scope changes over time.

This should save time and effort in the backend but does come at the cost of slightly more complex Front End development.

> [!TIP]
> Given the number of endpoints, it may be useful to consider using [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) to provide a more intuitive API.

### Organisations

#### `GET /v1/organisations`

Used to retrieve a list of organisation summary data for Regulators or Consultants to select from.

> N.B. For the sake of brevity: Regulators and Consultants will not be referred to in the following sections, but they will have the same read access.
>
> See the [Role-Based Access Control](#role-based-access-control) section for more details.

#### `GET /v1/organisations/{id}`

Used to retrieve an organisation by ID for Operators to view the sites, materials & accreditations associated with the organisation.

Registrations can be cancelled, Accreditations can be cancelled/suspended.

Cancelled registrations will result in changed permissions for PRNs and no reporting requirements
Cancelled/Suspended accreditations will result in changed permissions for PRNs and different reporting requirements.

### Summary Logs

#### `POST /v1/organisations/{id}/registrations/{id}/summary-logs`

Creates a new summary log and initiates the file upload process. The backend proxies the request to CDP Uploader and creates a tracking record.

1. Generates a new `summaryLogId`
2. Creates a SUMMARY-LOG entity with status `preprocessing`
3. Calls CDP Uploader's `/initiate` endpoint
4. Returns the `summaryLogId`, `uploadId`, `uploadUrl`, and `statusUrl` to the frontend

This allows the backend to track uploads from initiation, enabling better visibility into in-progress and abandoned uploads.

#### `GET /v1/organisations/{id}/registrations/{id}/summary-logs/{summaryLogId}`

Used to retrieve the current state and data of a summary log.

#### `POST /v1/organisations/{id}/registrations/{id}/summary-logs/{summaryLogId}/upload-completed`

Internal endpoint used by CDP Uploader to notify the backend when preprocessing is complete or has failed.

This endpoint both creates the SUMMARY-LOG entity (if it doesn't exist) and updates it with the file status and S3 details.

Request body matches CDP Uploader's callback payload:

```json
{
  "form": {
    "summaryLogUpload": {
      "fileId": "uuid",
      "filename": "summary-log.xlsx",
      "fileStatus": "complete" | "rejected" | "pending",
      "s3Bucket": "bucket-name",
      "s3Key": "path/to/file",
      "hasError": false,
      "errorMessage": "optional error message"
    }
  }
}
```

Creates or updates the SUMMARY-LOG entity with file details and sets status to `validating` (if scan succeeded) or `rejected` (if scan failed). If successful, triggers async validation.

> [!NOTE]
> The summary log entity is created by `POST /summary-logs` at initiate time with `preprocessing` status. This callback endpoint only updates existing records.

#### `POST /v1/organisations/{id}/registrations/{id}/summary-logs/{summaryLogId}/submit`

Used to submit a summary log to a registration, applying the validated changes to waste records.

> [!NOTE]
> To prevent race conditions and ensure data integrity, this endpoint should validate:
>
> - Summary log status must be `validated` (reject `preprocessing`, `rejected`, `validating`, `invalid`, or `submitted`)
> - Summary log must be the most recently uploaded for the given site + material (reject if a newer summary log exists)

### Waste Records

#### `GET /v1/organisations/{id}/registrations/{id}/waste-records`

Used to retrieve a list of waste records for Operators to select from.

#### `GET /v1/organisations/{id}/registrations/{id}/waste-records/{id}`

Used to retrieve a waste record by ID for Operators to view the events associated with the waste record.

#### `PUT /v1/organisations/{id}/registrations/{id}/waste-records/{id}/status`

Used to update a waste record's status

> [!INFO]
> This could alternatively be provided by a `PATCH` verb on the Waste Record resource, limited to the status field

> [!WARNING]
> N.B. This will need to be protected with role/permission authorisation

### PRNs

#### `POST /v1/organisations/{id}/registrations/{id}/packaging-recycling-notes`

Used to create packaging recycling notes for a material.

#### `PUT /v1/organisations/{id}/registrations/{id}/packaging-recycling-notes/{id}`

Used to update packaging recycling notes for a material.

#### `PUT /v1/organisations/{id}/registrations/{id}/packaging-recycling-notes/{id}/status`

Used to update a packaging recycling note's status.

> [!INFO]
> This could alternatively be provided by a `PATCH` verb on the PRN resource, limited to the status field

> [!WARNING]
> N.B. This will need to be protected with role/permission authorisation

#### `GET /v1/organisations/{id}/registrations/{id}/packaging-recycling-notes`

Used to retrieve a list of packaging recycling notes for a material.

#### `GET /v1/organisations/{id}/registrations/{id}/packaging-recycling-notes/{id}`

Used to retrieve a packaging recycling note by ID for Operators to view the details of the note.

#### RPD Integration

We will likely need some endpoints for integration purposes with RPD, this is an unknown at this stage.

### Reports

#### `POST /v1/organisations/{id}/registrations/{id}/reports`

Used to create a report for a material.

#### `PUT /v1/organisations/{id}/registrations/{id}/reports/{id}`

Used to update a report for a material. e.g. add "user entered" fields such as "weight of waste recycled", "weight of waste not recycled", "PRNs revenue"

> [!INFO]
> This could alternatively be provided by a `PATCH` verb on the Report resource, limited to the fields listed above

#### `PUT /v1/organisations/{id}/registrations/{id}/reports/{id}/approve`

Used to approve/submit a report.

> [!WARNING]
> N.B. This will need to be protected with role/permission authorisation

#### `GET /v1/organisations/{id}/reports`

Used to retrieve a list of reports for all materials.

#### `GET /v1/organisations/{id}/registrations/{id}/reports`

Used to retrieve a list of reports for a material.

#### `GET /v1/organisations/{id}/registrations/{id}/reports/{id}`

Used to retrieve a report by ID for Operators to view the details of the report.

### Waste Record

The Waste Record is the entity used to track key reporting data uploaded by Summary Logs.

TODO

- add Waste Balance to this ERD

> [!NOTE]
> `accreditationId` is optional on waste records to support organisations that have a registration but no accreditation.

#### Type: Received

In this example:

1. Alice has created a `received` waste record
2. Bob has updated the waste record, but introduced a mistake
3. Alice has corrected the mistake, but the reporting period is closed and the record is now pending

### Summary Log upload & ingest

> [!NOTE]
> The frontend only needs a single page to handle the entire upload and validation flow. The page polls the backend state document and updates the UI based on the current status, without requiring redirects between different URLs.
