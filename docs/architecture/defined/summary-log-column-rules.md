# Summary Log Column Rules

A per-column reference of every rule applied to a Summary Log, for all five templates.

> **Generated file.** This page is produced by `scripts/generate-column-rules.mjs` in the `epr-backend` service, which introspects the live table schemas. Do not edit it by hand: regenerate it after any change to a table schema, field schema or report-mandatory policy. Because it is derived from the code, it cannot drift from what actually validates uploads.

It brings together, per column, the rules documented separately in [Summary Log Row Validation Classification](summary-log-row-validation-classification.md), [Summary Log Validation Failure Codes](summary-log-validation-failure-codes.md) and [Report Creation Mandatory Fields](report-creation-mandatory-fields.md).

## How to read this

Column names are the **canonical field names** used internally and in validation error payloads and logs, not the exact spreadsheet header text.

- **Format rule (VAL010)** - the in-sheet validation applied to the value when the cell is filled. A failure REJECTS the row and blocks the whole submission. VAL010 only checks filled cells: an empty optional cell passes.
- **Treated as blank when** - values counted as unfilled in addition to an empty cell, typically Excel dropdown placeholders.
- **Required for Waste Balance (VAL011)** - whether the column must be filled for the row to contribute to the Waste Balance. A missing value here EXCLUDES the row from the balance but still allows submission. Shown as `n/a` for sections that never feed the balance.
- **Report-mandatory** - whether the column must be filled to create a Monthly Report, and the rule that requires it. The rule fires only when its trigger holds (for example a positive tonnage on the row): see [Report Creation Mandatory Fields](report-creation-mandatory-fields.md) for the triggers.

## Exporter (accredited)

### Exported sheet (`exported`)

This section feeds the Waste Balance.

Cross-field checks (VAL010, a failure rejects the row):

- must equal GROSS_WEIGHT − TARE_WEIGHT − PALLET_WEIGHT
- must equal the calculated tonnage based on NET_WEIGHT, WEIGHT_OF_NON_TARGET_MATERIALS, BAILING_WIRE_PROTOCOL, and RECYCLABLE_PROPORTION_PERCENTAGE
