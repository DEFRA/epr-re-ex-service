# Auditing updates to organisation

> [!WARNING]
> This document is a work in progress and is subject to change.

## Overview

There's no requirement to show changes to organisation data over time. However, it will be good to store history for auditing/debugging.
For summary log it has been decided to track changes over time as a field inside same record. This is a variation of [slowly changing dimension Type 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_changing_dimension).

Two options are being considered for organisation data.

1. Store the current version and historical versions in separate collections following [slowly changing dimension Type 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_changing_dimension).
   As organisation is a complex nested structure, it's easier to store full historic versions than working out what has changed
   One option is to write to organisation_audit everytime there's an update to organisation using [MongoDB change streams](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/changestreams/).

2. Every time there's an update a new record will be written to the audit table describing old and new value, who has changed.

Option 2 is being chosen as it can show summary of what has been changed and who.

  int version "version of the organisation record after this change was made"
}

  string fieldPath "The path to the field that was updated (e.g. 'companyDetails.name')"
  string oldValue "Previous value"
  string newValue "New value"
}

USER{
  string email
  string name
}
